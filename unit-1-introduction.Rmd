This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

[**UNIT 1. INTRODUCTION**]{.underline}

**CASE 1**

Exercise 1:

```{r}
sqrt(-17)
```

```{r}
sqrt(-17+0i)
```

```{r}
x<-5/0
```

```{r}
x
```

```{r}
exp(-x)
```

Exercise 2:

```{r}
x <- 5
y <- 2

x > y
x == y
x != y
```

**CASE 2**

Exercise 1:

```{r}
1+1+2+3+5+8

8-13

13*21

34*34

55/34 * sqrt (89)
```

Exercise 2:

```{r}
2 * 5 + 1

2 * (5 + 1)
```
